# Blockchain-Based Email Authentication System

## Abstract

In an era where email communication is a cornerstone of personal and professional interaction, ensuring the authenticity and integrity of emails is paramount. Traditional email protocols are vulnerable to spoofing, phishing, and spam, which can lead to security breaches and loss of trust. This whitepaper presents a blockchain-based email authentication system that leverages cryptographic hashing and blockchain technology to provide a decentralized, secure, and efficient method for verifying the authenticity of emails. The system introduces a mechanism where each email includes a hash of its essential content and a unique blockchain hash, creating a chain of trust that can be independently verified by recipients.

## Introduction

Email remains one of the most widely used communication tools globally. However, the simplicity and openness of the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) have led to significant security challenges. Malicious actors often exploit these vulnerabilities to send fraudulent emails, leading to phishing attacks, malware distribution, and data breaches.

Traditional solutions like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC provide some level of protection but are often insufficient due to their reliance on centralized authorities and their complexity in implementation. There is a growing need for a more robust, decentralized approach to email authentication that can enhance security without adding significant overhead or complexity.

This whitepaper introduces a blockchain-based email authentication system that embeds cryptographic hashes and utilizes a local blockchain on the sender's email server to authenticate emails. The system is designed to be simple, efficient, and compatible with existing email infrastructure.

## How the System Works

### Overview

The proposed system integrates a blockchain mechanism into the email sending process. Each email is processed through an SMTP proxy on the sender's email server that performs the following actions:

1. **Hashing the Email Content**: The SMTP proxy computes a SHA-256 hash of the email's essential content, including:

   - **From**: The sender's email address.
   - **To**: The recipient's email address(es).
   - **Cc**: The carbon copy recipient(s).
   - **Subject**: The email's subject line.
   - **Body**: The email's message content.
   - **Attachments**: Any files attached to the email.

   **Note**: Headers that may be altered or added by intermediate servers (e.g., received headers, BCC) are excluded from the hash computation to ensure consistency between the sender and recipient.

2. **Generating the Blockchain Hash**:

   - **Retrieve the Previous Blockchain Hash**: The SMTP proxy retrieves the previous blockchain hash from the local blockchain on the sender's server.
   - **Compute the New Blockchain Hash**: The new blockchain hash is computed by combining:

     - The **previous blockchain hash**.
     - The **current email content hash**.
     - An optional **seed** or **timestamp** (not included in the email headers).

     This combination ensures that the blockchain hash is unique for each email and forms the foundational link in the blockchain chain.

3. **Recording on the Local Blockchain**: The new blockchain hash is recorded on the sender's local blockchain, along with the current email content hash and a timestamp.

4. **Adding Headers to the Email**: The email is modified to include custom headers:

   - `X-Email-Hash`: The hash of the current email content.
   - `X-Email-Blockchain-Hash`: The unique blockchain hash for this email.
   - `X-Email-Hash-Algorithm`: The algorithm used to compute the hashes (e.g., `SHA-256`).

5. **Forwarding the Email**: The modified email is forwarded to the destination SMTP server for delivery.


### Verification Process

When the recipient receives the email, they can verify its authenticity through the following steps:

1. **Rehash the Email Content**: The recipient rehashes the received email's essential content (from, to, cc, subject, body, attachments) using the same hashing algorithm specified in `X-Email-Hash-Algorithm` to generate a hash.

2. **Compare Hashes**: The recipient compares the generated hash with the `X-Email-Hash` header from the email.

   - **If they match**: It confirms that the email content has not been altered during transit.
   - **If they do not match**: The email may have been tampered with or corrupted.

3. **Send Verification Request**: If the hashes match, the recipient's client sends a verification request to the sender's server, providing the `X-Email-Blockchain-Hash`.

4. **Sender's Server Response**:

   - The sender's server looks up the blockchain hash exactly as it was sent in the verification request.
   - It retrieves the corresponding current email content hash from its local blockchain.
   - The server returns the current email content hash to the recipient.

5. **Blockchain Verification**: The recipient compares the email content hash received from the sender's server with the `X-Email-Hash` from the email.

   - **If they match**: The email is verified as authentic and part of the sender's blockchain chain.
   - **If they do not match**: The email may not be from the purported sender or could be fraudulent.

### Example Flow

#### Sender

- **Sends Email**:

  - **Step 1**: Computes the email content hash.

    ```
    Email Content Hash (X-Email-Hash):

    ```

  - **Step 3**: Computes the new blockchain hash by combining the previous blockchain hash and the current email content hash.

    ```
    New Blockchain Hash (X-Email-Blockchain-Hash):
    SHA-256(previous_hash + email_content_hash) = f7a9c8b6d5e4f3a2b1c0d9e8f7a6b5c4e3d2c1b0a9f8e7d6c5b4a3f2e1d0c9b8
    ```

  - **Step 4**: Records the new blockchain hash, current email content hash, and timestamp on the local blockchain.

  - **Step 5**: Adds the following headers to the email:

    ```
    X-Email-Hash: e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855
